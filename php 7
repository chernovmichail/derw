/*Double value every next call PHP 7 Kyu Kata

#Description:
This kata is about static method that should return different values. On the first call it must be 1, on the second and others - it must be a double from previous value.

Look tests for more examples, good luck :)

# Solution:

class A
{
  private static int $n = 1;
  
  public static function getNumber(): int
  {
    $n = self::$n;
    
    self::$n*= 2;
    
    return $n;
  }
}
